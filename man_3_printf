.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf
.PP
The function produces output according to a format as described below. The function _printf() writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.

.SH RETURN VALUES

Upon successful return, this function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH FORMAT STRING

The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift state, if any. The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. In between there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision and an optional length modifier.

.SH OPTIONS

%s - string

%d - decimal

%i - integer

%c - character

%b - binary

.SH EXAMPLES

An example of an implementation: 

	_printf("Hello %s\n", "world");

would print "Hello world" with a new line after it.
